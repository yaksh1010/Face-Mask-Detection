# Face-Mask-Prediction
The Face Mask Detection Model is an innovative application of machine learning technology aimed at improving public safety and health by identifying individuals who are wearing face masks and those who are not. Developed using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, this model offers a reliable and efficient solution for enforcing mask-wearing protocols in various settings, including public spaces, workplaces, and transportation hubs.

Applications:

Public Health Monitoring: Deployed in public spaces such as airports, train stations, and shopping centers, the model facilitates proactive monitoring of mask-wearing compliance and helps prevent the spread of contagious diseases.
Workplace Safety: Integrated into workplace surveillance systems, the model assists employers in enforcing mask-wearing policies and maintaining a safe and healthy work environment for employees and visitors.
Transportation Security: Implemented in transportation hubs and vehicles, the model enhances passenger safety by identifying individuals who may pose a risk due to non-compliance with mask-wearing regulations.
